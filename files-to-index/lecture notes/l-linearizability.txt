6.5840 2024 Lecture 4: Consistency, Linearizability

today's topic: consistency models, specifically linearizability

we need to be able to reason about correct behavior for network services.
  e.g. what application programmers can expect from GFS or Lab 2
  -->> consistency model

what's a consistency model?
  a specification for the relationship of different clients' views of a service
  I'll focus on key/value storage with network clients
    put(k, v) -> <done>
    get(k) -> v
  given some put/get calls, what outcome(s) are valid?

in ordinary programming, there's nothing to talk about
  a read yields the last value that was written

what might cause doubt about correct behavior?
  [simple diagrams]
  concurrent reads/writes
  replicas
  caches
  failure, recovery
  lost messages
  retransmission

why does a storage system need a formal consistency model?
  for applications, hard to be correct w/o guarantees from storage
    e.g. producer computes, then executes
      put("result", 27)
      put("done", true)
    consumer executes
      while get("done") != true
        pause
      v = get(result)
    is v guaranteed to be 27, no matter what?
  for services, hard to design/implement/optimize w/o a specification
    e.g. is it OK for clients to read from GFS replicas (rather than primary)?

there are lots of consistency models
  sometimes driven by desire to simplify application programmers' lives
  and sometimes codifying behavior that was convenient for implementors
  also, lots of overlapping definitions from different fields
    e.g. FS, databases, CPU memory
  today: linearizability
  but we'll also see:
    eventual consistency
    causal consistency
    fork consistency
    serializability
  driving force: performance / convenience / robustness tradeoffs

linearizability
  it's a specification -- a requirement for how a service must behave
  it's usually what people mean by "strong consistency".
    matches programmer intuitions reasonably well.
    but rules out many optimizations.
  you'll implement a linearizable key/value store in Lab 2.
    and again in Lab 4, this time with fault tolerance.

starting point
  we assume that there's a serial spec for what individual operations do
  serial = a single server executing operations one at a time
  db[]
  put(k, v):
    db[k] = v
    return true
  get(k):
    return db[k]
  no surprises here.

what about concurrent client operations?
  a client sends a request;
    takes some time crossing the network;
    server computes, talks to replicas, &c;
    reply moves through network;
    client receives reply
  other clients may send/receive/be waiting during that time!
  we need a way to describe concurrent scenarios,
    so we can talk about which are/aren't valid

definition: a history
  describes a time-line of possibly-concurrent operations
  each operation has invocation and response times (RPC)
    as well as argument and return values
  example:
    C1: |-Wx1-| |-Wx2-|
    C2:   |---Rx2---|
  the x-axis is real time
    |- indicates the time at which client sent request
    -| indicates the time at which the client received the reply
  "Wx1" means "write value 1 to record x" -- put(x, 1)
  "Rx1" means "a read of record x yielded value 1" -- get(x) -> 1
  C1 sent put(x, 1), got reply, sent put(x, 2), got reply
  C2 get(x), got reply=2
  note that writes have responses; no return value other than "done"

a history is usually a trace of what clients saw in an actual execution
  used to check correct behavior
  also used by designers in "would this be OK" though experiments

definition: a history is linearizable if
  * you can find a point in time for each operation
    between its invocation and response, and
  * the history's result values are the same as serial
    execution in that point order.

example history 1:
  |-Wx1-| |-Wx2-|
    |---Rx2---|
      |-Rx1-|

is this history linearizable?
  can we find a linearization point for each operation?
  we may need to try a few different point assignments.
  this order of points satisfies the rules:
    Wx1 Rx1 Wx2 Rx2
  1. each point lies between invocation and response.
  2. the sequence satisfies the serial put/get spec.

note: either read could have returned either 1 or 2.
  so linearizability often allows multiple different outcomes.
  so we often can't predict in advance, but we can check afterwards.

what can we do with the linearizability definition?
  for designer: could this optimization result in non-linearizable results?
  for programmer: what can I assume / expect as a client?
  for testing: generate requests, check observed history.

why is it called "linearizability"?
  the linearization points turn concurrent operations
    into a serial execution -- "linear".
  thus "linearizable" in the sense that it can be converted to a
    linear series of operations.

example 2:
  |-Wx1-| |----Wx2----|
    |--Rx2--|
              |-Rx1-|
we can try a few assignments of linearization points.
  how about Wx1 Wx2 Rx2 Rx1?
  that's not valid because "Wx2 Rx1" doesn't conform to serial spec.
how to show something *isn't* linearizable?
  show that no assignment of points works.
    i.e. breaks either time rule or value rule.
  there are only 24 orders in this example, we could try them all.
sometimes you can take shortcuts to eliminate lots of orders
  e.g. time says that neither Wx2 nor Rx1 can come first
    so we need only consider orders that start w/ Wx1 or Rx2
no order works here!
  Wx2's point must be before Rx2's point
  so Wx2's point is also before Rx1's point
  so the second read got an impossible value
thus, if a system could produce this history, we would know that the
  system wasn't linearizable: has a bug, or never promised linearizability.
the Rx1 *would* have been legal if there had been no Rx2
so, if we want linearizability:
  can't un-do a revealed write (e.g. if crash causes server to forget).
  can't reveal divergent replicas to clients.

linearizability checkers are usually based on exhaustive search over orders
  plus lots of cleverness to cut down on work required

GFS is not linearizable: it can produce the example 2 history since
  the Rx1 could come from a replica that hasn't yet been updated.
  if we wanted GFS to be linearizable,
    one approach is to have client reads go through the primary too.
    would be slower!

example 3:
|--Wx0--|  |--Wx1--|
            |--Wx2--|
        |-Rx2-| |-Rx1-|
this may look non-linearizable because it might
  seem that the Rx2 should force the 2nd read to
  see 2 as well.
but this order shows it's linearizable: Wx0 Wx2 Rx2 Wx1 Rx1
so:
  the service can pick either order for concurrent writes.
  the linear order can be different from start-time or end-time order!

example 4:
|--Wx0--|  |--Wx1--|
            |--Wx2--|
C1:     |-Rx2-| |-Rx1-|
C2:     |-Rx1-| |-Rx2-|
can there be a serial order?
  C1 needs Wx2 Rx2 Wx1 Rx1
  C2 needs Wx1 Rx1 Wx2 Rx2
  we can't have both Wx2 before Wx1, and Wx2 after Wx1.
  so not linearizable.
so:
  service can choose either order for concurrent writes
  but all clients must see the writes in the same order
  this is important when there are replicas or caches
    they all have to execute operations in the same order

example 5:
|-Wx1-|
        |-Wx2-|
                |-Rx1-|
can order include Wx2 Rx1?
  no: the read doesn't see the latest written value
can order include Rx1 Wx2?
  no: the order has to preserve order if one op ends before another starts
no order is possible -- not linearizable
so:
  reads must return fresh data: stale values aren't linearizable
  even if the reader doesn't know about the write
    the time rule requires reads to yield the latest data

linearizability outlaws many attractive design possibilities / mistakes:
  split brain (two active leaders)
  forgetting completed writes after a crash+reboot
  reading from lagging replicas

example 6:
[client / network / server diagram]
C1 calls put(x, 1)
C2 calls put(x, 2)
service receives C1's request;
  network drops response;
  C1's RPC library re-sends request
is it legal for service to execute *both* of C1's request messages?
we then might see this if C3 reads three times:
C1: |--------Wx1---------| (due to retransmission)
C2:        |-Wx2-|
C3:   |-Rx1-| |-Rx2-|  |-Rx1-|
assume x starts out as zero
this history is not linearizable!
so, if we want linearizability:
  duplicate requests from retransmissions must be suppressed!
  Lab 2...

example 7:
suppose the service remembers each request+response,
  detect duplicate requests,
  reply with same value as for first copy of the request.
  (in general the server must save the result, since can't re-execute)
for writes, this eliminates the duplicate execution -- good.
but for reads, this may yield a saved value that is now out of date!
what does linearizabilty say?
C1: |-Wx3-|          |-Wx4-|
C2:          |-Rx3-------------|
C2's first request before Wx4, re-sends after Wx4
a valid order: Wx3 Rx3 Wx4
so: returning the old saved value 3 is correct
    returning 4 is also correct! (but only b/c read has no side-effects)

linearizable systems are not limited to just read and write operations
  delete
  increment
  append
  test-and-set (to implement locks)
  any operation on server state

application programmers like linearizability -- it's relatively easy to use:
  * reads see fresh data -- not stale
  * all clients see the same data (when there aren't writes)
  * all clients see data changes in the same order
    so my put(v,27); put(done,true); example works
  the value of these properties will be clearer when we look at
    systems with weaker consistencies.

how can we implement linearizability?
  depends on how much replication, caching, and fault-tolerance we want.

single serial server that doesn't crash.
  [diagram: clients, server, op queue, state]
  server picks an order for concurrently arriving client requests.
  executes them in that order, one at a time,
    replies to each before starting the next.
  plus duplicate request detection
  plus crash recovery (must write to disk...)

what if we want high availability?

primary/backup replication
  [diagram: primary, two backups]
  all requests go to the primary
    picks a serial order
    forwards to backups
    backups execute in the same order
    primary replies to client only after both backups have executed
    so, if client saw response, all backups guaranteed to have executed
      important if primary fails
      to avoid forgetting completed requests
  clients cannot send reads directly to a backup, as in GFS
    C1 might see new value, subsequently C1 might see old value
  need an external party to decide when backup should take over
    to avoid split brain
    e.g. GFS coordinator

what about the performance of linearizable systems?
  bad news: serial aspect may make it hard to get parallel speedup
  bad news: if replication, then lots of communication
  bad news: if replication, replicas must be reachable,
            limiting fault tolerance
  good news: you can shard if keys are independent

what about other consistency models?
  can they allow better performance?
  do they have intuitive semantics?

example: eventual consistency -- a weak model
  multiple copies of the data (e.g. in different datacenters, for speed)
  a read consults any one replica (e.g. closest)
  a write updates any one replica (e.g. closest)
    client gets response when that one update is done
  replicas synchronize updates in the background
    eventually, other replicas will see my update

eventual consistency is pretty popular
  faster than linearizability
    especially if replicas are in different cities for fault-tolerance
  and more available -- any one replica will do
    no waiting for primary/backup communication
  Amazon's Dynamo; Cassandra

but eventual consistency exposes some anomalies to application programmer:
  * a read may not see the most recent write -- reads can see stale data
    a problem for password change, ACL change
  * writes may appear out of order
    breaks my result/done example
  * different clients may see different data
  * concurrent writes to same item need to be resolved somehow!
    C1: put(x, 1)
    C2: put(x, 2)
    may initially be applied at different replicas
    only later will they be pushed to other replicas
    how to merge concurrent new values?
    how to ensure all replicas choose the same final value?
      so that, eventually, they are identical?
  * eventual consistency cannot support e.g. test-and-set

A general pattern: you can usually choose only one of these:
  Strong consistency
  Maximum availability

But not both.
  Strong consistency makes you wait to update replicas,
    and can't proceed if too many replicas are unavailable.
    Thus poor availability.
  Eventual consistency can proceed even if no other replicas are reachable.
    But has poor consistency.
